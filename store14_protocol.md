# Store#14 Protocol — "Don't Scream. Sense."

## Design Vision
We’re not building another app. We are shaping the emotional AI-hardware bridge.

## Key Components
- **Pen-Pocket**: A hardware pen that captures thoughts without touch.
- **Thought Linker**: AI that connects users via thought-matching, not identity.
- **Voice Syncing**: Future extension with Veo3 to allow users to express and sync thoughts vocally.

## Privacy Principles
- No identity-first matching.
- All data must serve *meaning*, not monetization.
- Users own their memory arc.
